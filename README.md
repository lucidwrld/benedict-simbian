This project demonstrates the difference in security operations with and without Simbian using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The implementation focuses on scroll-triggered animations to create an engaging, interactive comparison that highlights Simbian's advantages.

# Thought Process
- I designed this comparison to:

- Clearly contrast "Without Simbian" (red theme) vs "With Simbian" (green theme)

- Use progressive animations that trigger on scroll for better UX

- Maintain visual consistency while providing meaningful motion

- Ensure full responsiveness across all device sizes

The animation flow was carefully planned to:

First show the chaotic "Without Simbian" state with frequent alerts

Transition through the comparison section

Conclude with the organized "With Simbian" solution

# Technologies Used
- Next.js 14 (App Router)

- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Framer Motion for animations (chosen for its excellent React integration and scroll detection)

- React Icons for vector icons

# Known Issues & Potential Improvements 
- Could implement will-change properties for smoother animations

- Might add loading states for complex animations 

- Add more detailed hover effects

- Include touch-friendly mobile animations 

- More comprehensive comparison points

- Real-world metrics integration  

- More granular component splitting

- Custom easing functions for animations
